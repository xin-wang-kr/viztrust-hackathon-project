# VizTrust: A Visual Analytics Tool for Capturing User Trust Development in Human-AI Communication

This is project submission to LLM Agent Hackathon. 

Abstract: Trust is a cornerstone of effective human-agent communication, influencing user satisfaction, engagement, and adoption. Despite its importance, trust development during interactions remains complex, shaped by multidimensional factors such as conversational behaviors, linguistic markers, and emotional tones. VizTrust addresses this challenge by introducing a systematic, real-time visual analytics tool that captures and analyzes user trust dynamics in human-agent communication. Built on principles from social psychology, VizTrust employs a multi-agent framework to evaluate trust across four dimensions: competence, integrity, benevolence, and predictability. It integrates metrics such as user engagement, politeness strategies, and emotional tones to visualize trust evolution throughout conversations. Researchers and developers can utilize this tool to gain actionable insights into trust formation, supporting the design of adaptive conversational agents that respond effectively to user trust signals. By bridging the gap between static survey methods and the dynamic nature of trust, VizTrust advances the understanding of trust perception and its interplay with social signals, paving the way for more empathetic and reliable AI systems.
